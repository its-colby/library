# Abstract Algebra

## Operations

### Properties of 1 Operation
    - associativity: a⋅(b⋅c) = (a⋅b)⋅c
    - commutativity: a⋅b = b⋅a
    - idempotence: a⋅a = a
    - antisymmetry: a⋅b = -b⋅a
    - identity
    - inverse
### Properties of 2 Operations
    - left distributivity
    - right distributivity
    - distributivity: a⋅(b+c) = a⋅b + a⋅c
    - absorption laws: a⋅(a+b) = a, a+(a⋅b) = a

### Examples
    - vector addition
    - scalar multiplication

## Structures

### Types
    - semigroup: associative operation
    - monoid: semigroup with identity
    - group: monoid with inverses
    - abelian group: group with commutativity
    - ring: abelian group with another semigroup, distributive over the abelian group
    - commutative ring: ring with commutativity
    - field: commutative ring with inverses
    - lattice: set with two operations, satisfying absorption laws, commutativity, associativity, and idempotence
    - boolean algebra: lattice with complementation, distributivity
    - Lie algebra: bilinear operation with antisymmetry and Jacobi identity
    - Module/Vector Space

### Further Properties
    - Noetherian
    - Dedekind
    - Euclidean
    - Principal Ideal
    - Unique Factorization
    - GCD
    - Integral Domain
    - Integrally Closed Domain
    - Algebraically Closed Field

### Theorems of Classification
    - Wedderburn's little theorem: all finite division rings are commutative and therefore finite fields.

### Examples
    - 


## Extended Structures

### Types
    - Ideals
    - Quotient Rings
    - Products/Sums
    - Extensions


## Maps

### Function Properties
    - injectivity: f(a) = f(b) implies a = b, one-to-one
    - surjectivity: for every b in codomain, there exists an a in domain such that f(a) = b, onto
    - bijectivity: injective and surjective

### Map Properties
    - homomorphic: structure-preserving, respects operations, inverses, and identities
    - isomorphism: bijective homomorphism (implying inverse exists)
    - endomorphism: morphism from a structure to itself
    - automorphism: bijective endomorphism

### Examples
    - group homomorphisms: determinant, exponential, logarithmic
    - ring homomorphisms: modulo, complex conjugation
    - field homomorphisms: complex to real projection
    - isomorphisms: rotations/reflections of vector spaces, fourier transform
