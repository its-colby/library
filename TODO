better naming like notation instead of declaration
switch some entities to structures like a number field for example
ideal mult/addition
R to R/I surjective homomorphism
tex refactor
ui block  and statementfix up
make TEX class with . syntax chaining
example as children of statement or conditions, more fine-grained labels
