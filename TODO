adjust fonts to use scss variables
use rem over px

On big screen - widen TOC by 20/30 px, center align content container, scrolling bar on chrome issue

On mobile screen - font sizes (make everything em/rem)

On non mobile screens - scrolling of TOC should jump by more than 1 header

change naming to be more consistent

smaller file sizes, better hierarchy

maybe tightly couple book UI and JS lib?

finish maximal ideals content

start with some prelimary small standalone content for other topics, then aggregate over time?
