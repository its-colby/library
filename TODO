On non mobile screens - scrolling of TOC should jump by more than 1 header

search bar for content
more colors and standardize them?
on-hover definitions
links within content

maybe standardize prerequisite material digression as optional for each chapter and better stylize the UI
maybe standardize a "read before and read next - recommended sections at start and end of each book"

maybe on hover on home page shows table of contents somehow?

add more hierarchy
