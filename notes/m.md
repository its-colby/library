Ideals
- historical motivation: Ernst Kummer and Richard Dedekind. They were grappling with the unique factorization of integers in number fields. Elements of some rings didn't seem to factor uniquely, but ideals did. Ex: Z[sqrt(-5)], 6 = 2*3 = (1+sqrt(-5))(1-sqrt(-5))
- an additive subgroup of a ring. a group under addition. I forms a smaller group within 
R under addition
- closed under multiplication by any ring element. if r in R and i in I, then ri in I

Principal Ideals:
- an ideal generated by a single element
- a divides b if b is contained in principal ideal generated by a
- (a) = {ra | r in R}
- in principal ideal domains, every ideal is principal and is integral domain, like Z

Quotient Rings:
- R/I
- two elements in R are equivalent if their difference is in I

Algebraic Integers:
- root of monic polynomial with integer coefficients

Number Fields:
- field extension of Q

Function Fields:
- 

Trace
- sum of embeddings

Norm
- Among elementary applications, the trace can be used to show some number is not in a field and the norm can be used to show some number in L is not a perfect power in L 
- The math behind the definitions of the trace and norm also leads to a systematic way of finding the minimal polynomial over K of each element of L.
