# Ways to Submit via Opponent's Neck
- pinpoint pressure (bottom radius/ulna), trachea (anything really), carotid (shoulder, forearm, bicep), pop head off, lateral crank, forward/backward crank, rotation crank,

connection point(s), direct force, lever force
must focus on the connection point, then force, not force then connection point


north-south (pec, shoulder/forearm in same line), ruotolotine, marce, guillotines, von flu

-> gi chokes


seated kata gatame (close to guillotine, arm-in on carotid) - guillotines not arm-in on carotid (for high wrist - it seems bicep/forearm and side crunch), others = twist neck and crunch it in? or trachea, for mounted guillotine, still the same, side crunch



position before submission, HOWEVER you sometimes use the threat of submission (b4 a good position) to force a reaction and then advance to better position


# Top Arm Triangle Strangle
## Finishing Mechanics
- Laterally bend your neck to trap the defender's upper humerus between your shoulder, upper trapezius,  and your neck. This will affix the defender's deltoid to his carotid.
- Your bicep should be on the defender's far carotid, with your hand pronated to prevent shorterning of the bicep.
- Your leg should always be across (at minimum) the defender's near hip, either mounted or in half guard, to prevent the defender from a pendulum escape.
- Keep your hands clasped in a gable grip to keep your garotte in place.
- Tripod to bring your hips higher up the body, so that your head and non-garotte elbow can come up higher while corkscrewing. Your head can push the top of the defender's head into your garotte. Lastly, sprawl the near hip to force a greater bend in the elbow of your garotte. 
## Late Stage Defense
- answer the phone, pendulum with leg, pendulum and throw phone to offender's far hip, turn to far side

when crunching chin to chest, restricts airflow without trachea pressure,

# North South Strangle
## Finishing Mechanics
- ensure as you scoot down bicep arm stays fixed down low, ideally, their trachea ends up in your elbow cavity, and your chest pushes their head other way (needs to be a bit high for this) and dont drive elbow down (it would be on their trachea) until their trachea is in your elbow cavity, does the chest push the trachea in the right spot, or/and does it push head into garotte? closer the non garotte elbow is to your hip, the more you can turn other shoulder down.
- escapes? 

# Marce
- upside down darce?
- trachea in elbow cavity?
- escapes?

# mounted guillotine
- ribs push head into garotte, forearm on far artery, near artery kinda in ribs too?

# guillotine
- keep head locked in there with shoulder over


## Ruotolotine 
- your bicep to opponent's near armpit
- your forearm to opponent's far carotid
- allow scapula to protract and elevate
- figure four to keep your garotte in place
- depress scapula with your lat to pull your garotte into opponent's carotid

## Anaconda
- your bicep to opponents cervical spine
- your forearm to opponents far carotid
- bridge into opponent's head to push their carotid into your garotte

## Darce
- your forearm to opponents near carotid

## Bottom Arm-In Guillotine
- 

## Mounted Arm-In Guillotine


## Von Flu 
- failed guillotine
- shoulder to opponent's near carotid

# Cross Collar w/ Lapel
- your supinated wrist to opponent's lapel to their far carotid
- your pronated wrist to opponent's far collar
- finish as darce

# Loop Guillotine (can do mounted as well)
- your grip to opponent's far lapel and loop their head
- wrist + collar to finish

# Clcok
- rear naked with collor/wrist basically, sprawl hip, heavy over head tripod, use lat to pull

# lapel 
- go around

#no gi basebsll
- forearm to same carotid
- s rip behindhead
