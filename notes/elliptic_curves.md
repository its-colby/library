cubic equation: ax³ + bx²y + cxy² + dy³ + ex² + fxy + gy² + hx + iy + j = 0

Reducible: Can be factored into products of lower-degree polynomials

Weierstrass transformation.

General Weierstrass form: y² + a₁xy + a₃y = x³ + a₂x² + a₄x + a₆

Simplified equation: y² = x³ + ax + b
Valid in fields of characteristic ≠ 2 or 3
The curve is non-singular if 4a³ + 27b² ≠ 0

Rational points can be constructed by the method of tangents and secants detailed . THIS. this is why we use this method. so we can stay in the same field when doing operations.q
