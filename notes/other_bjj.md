# standing up from turtle

no inside space (for leg hooks or wrist rides, tight waists, etc)
want their weight off you

# takedowns

## defending leg grabs
- use head in their clavicle while moving feet back
- can use hand posts, but keep elbows in?
- if opponent has leg grip but still on ground, sprawl with head over hips
- hand on leg = sprawl and square up - hip thrust on shoulder of grabbing arm
- when their grip fails, twist hips out and get athletic position
- get side angle, kock over side breakdown, body lock - go for wrist
- side breakdown with ankle is option
one option for go behind = backhand on scapula drag thing, keep weight on them
- go behind can also utilize cross inside drag
- when you downlock, elbows stay in and forearm to clavicles

- go behind can also use chinstrap and turn chip oppo side

- when they drive into you (getting single from turtle), let shoeleaces relax

- when in front head, jam him to sit back on his ankles with your hips
-snap them down after you jam them

- baseball slide go behind?


- defend single - can also hit them with hips mid shot, turn hips angle drive weight onto back leg, then crotch lock


- high crotch, circle and pull him down, their head on outside, belly grab to make sure they dont run the corner.....last resort is grab far ankle (must get your hip off their shoulder tho)....can also push head away.. can also transition to head inside. block double leg
