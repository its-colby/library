# standing up from turtle

no inside space (for leg hooks or wrist rides, tight waists, etc)
want their weight off you

# takedowns

## defending leg grabs
- use head in their clavicle while moving feet back
- can use hand posts, but keep elbows in?
- if opponent has leg grip but still on ground, sprawl with head over hips
- hand on leg = sprawl and square up - hip thrust on shoulder of grabbing arm
- when their grip fails, twist hips out and get athletic position
- get side angle, kock over side breakdown, body lock - go for wrist
- side breakdown with ankle is option
one option for go behind = backhand on scapula drag thing, keep weight on them
- go behind can also utilize cross inside drag
- when you downlock, elbows stay in and forearm to clavicles

- go behind can also use chinstrap and turn chip oppo side

- when they drive into you (getting single from turtle), let shoeleaces relax

- when in front head, jam him to sit back on his ankles with your hips
-snap them down after you jam them

- baseball slide go behind?


- defend single - can also hit them with hips mid shot, turn hips angle drive weight onto back leg, then crotch lock


- high crotch, circle and pull him down, their head on outside, belly grab to make sure they dont run the corner.....last resort is grab far ankle (must get your hip off their shoulder tho)....can also push head away.. can also transition to head inside. block double leg





# dominant controls

the following are conditions when a muscle is entirely non effective or least effective
- when permanently fully-contracted, any further exertion won't have any effect (quad extension when lying supine)
- when the antagonist force is at the end of the lever (leg raise with weight on feet)
- when there is no connection point (hip thrust with legs dangling off an edge)
- when there is nowhere to move (prone hip thrust)

- effective defensive movement w/ legs = run away / frame / build height / clinch

- An immovable load, namely, the ground.
- An overcoming load. opponent's weight, your weight, small surface area, end of lever
- no ability to contract
- no load or ground ??

an ability to maintain it, and not use too many weapons


A person's interaction with the outside world is facilitated by their muscles. Muscles exert influence by being anchored to bones through insertion points, which in turn connect to the external environment. For this effect to occur, the muscle must be capable of contraction.

Thus, a muscle has no effect if the
a) contraction is not stronger than its load (immovable load - wall/ground, overcoming load - opponent's weight, your weight, small surface area, end of lever)
b) the muscle has maximally shortened and cannot be contracted further
c) it is not anchored to the external environment through the bones.

so arms

lat, chest, shoulder, bicep, tricep, (forearm is useless)

lat: a) somewhat unrealistic but perhaps arm above head b) arm by side or across c) arm by side or across
chest: a) arm to side or above head b) arm by side or across c) arm by side or across
shoulder: a) arm above head b) arm pinned by side or across

so for arms, its arm pinned above head, 


Let's systematically go through each muscle and determine how to shut it down. For simplicity, we will look at an opponent in the bottom position on the ground.

Gluteus Maximus: posterior sacrum <-> posterior femur. a kickback or a hip thrust. a hip thrust is the only meaningful defensive movement. a) only grounds and walls are effective, not bodyweight. b) and a bit of a but don't allow hip flexion so leg straight. c) feet off floor. In summary, 1) prone 2) leg straight 3) tibia in air. 

Quadriceps: a) only grounds and walls are effective, not bw b) leg straight c) tibia in air.

Hamstrings: 0) prone no meaningful movement a) leg straight b) foot to butt c) tibia in air.

adductors, hip flexion, abductors, calf, shin useless

so 1) prone 2) leg straight via load on ankle up to lower femur 3) tibia in air, so:

so
a) prone, load body on lower back or up
b) orthogonal load on ankle up to lower femur of both legs
c) orthogonal load on tibia of one leg, other leg hamstring stretch
d) legs sideways load on ankle up to lower femur
--exceptions below
e) supine, load body on thoracic spine or up, with no possible attachment from legs
f) backpack

now, how do you maintain these positions?

a) prone -> cant let spine get off ground -> cant let their arms push off the ground
b) orthogonal load -> cant let them push the load off
e) can't let them push you down their body or shimmy themselves up or down

let's come back to this later


now, how to upgrade from one position to the next?
