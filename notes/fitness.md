# Programming


# Goals

# Adaptation

# Strength

# Injury
- no improper movement, just improper preparation....but most people are improperly prepared at any given time for continuous stress (as opposed to trying something out 1 time)
- people often work the same muscle
- overuse injury is preventable through programming and awareness of how to train
- flexibility does not help overuse injuries
- acute injury is preventable via getting stronger (sometimes more flexible)
