// (1/2)Z is a fractional ideal of Z
// why does it need to be over an integral domain?
// for dedekind domains, Every non-zero fractional ideal can be uniquely factored into a product of prime ideals with integer exponents
// An integral domain is a Dedekind domain if and only if every non-zero fractional ideal is invertible.

// a fractional ideal is invertible if IJ = R
