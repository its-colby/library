Once the term "ring" was introduced, it was clear that integral domains were a specific type of ring. It was also clear that there existed a mathematical structure between rings and integral domainsâ€”a structure that had all the properties of a ring, but not all the properties of an "integral domain". This structure was later named a "domain".`,
