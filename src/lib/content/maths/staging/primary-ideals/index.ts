Primary Ideals
- every ideal of a Noetherian ring has a primary decomposition, that is, can be written as an intersection of finitely many primary ideals. This result is known as the Laskerâ€“Noether theorem. Consequently,[1] an irreducible ideal of a Noetherian ring is primary.
- A proper ideal Q of R is primary if and only if every zero divisor in R/Q is nilpotent. 
- If Q is a primary ideal, then the radical of Q is necessarily a prime ideal P, and this ideal is called the associated prime ideal of Q.
- If P is a maximal prime ideal, then any ideal containing a power of P is P-primary.
