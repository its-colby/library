Ideal Class Group / Picard Group
- Thus (dedekind) these are precisely the class of domains for which Frac(R)/Prin(R) forms a group, the ideal class group Cl(R) of R.  ..... Picard group Pic(R)
- fractional ideals
- class group
- the ideal class group is constructed in a different way, and there is a canonical homomorphism Pic(R) â†’ Cl(R)
- steinitz class,  Grothendieck group
- The ideal class group is trivial (i.e. has only one element) if and only if all ideals of R are principal. In this sense, the ideal class group measures how far R is from being a principal ideal domain, and hence from satisfying unique prime factorization
-  In fact, every abelian group is isomorphic to the ideal class group of some Dedekind domain.
- Computation of the class group is hard, in general; it can be done by hand for the ring of integers in an algebraic number field of small discriminant, using Minkowski's bound.
