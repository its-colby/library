Noetherian Rings
- If R is a Noetherian ring, then the polynomial ring  Hilbert's basis theorem.
- If R is a Noetherian ring and I is a two-sided ideal, then the quotient ring R/I is also Noetherian.
- Every finitely-generated commutative algebra over a commutative Noetherian ring is Noetherian.
- Every localization of a commutative Noetherian ring is Noetherian.
