// free
// For a ring R, a module P is free if and only if it is isomorphic to R^n for some n (where n could be infinite). This is actually the definition of a free module.
// If a module over a ring is free, then its rank must be constant at all prime ideals

// a ring is always free over itself
// Over a principal ideal domain (e.g., 
// Z
// {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} }), a submodule of a free module is free


// A finitely generated module over a commutative local ring is free if and only if it is faithfully flat

// Sometimes, whether a module is free or not is undecidable in the set-theoretic sense. A famous example is the Whitehead problem, which asks whether a Whitehead group is free or not.
