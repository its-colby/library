principal ideal domains
- structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain (PID)
- In a principal ideal domain, any two elements a,b have a greatest common divisor, which may be obtained as a generator of the ideal (a, b).
- Every principal ideal domain is a unique factorization domain (UFD)
- a Dedekind–Hasse norm is a function on an integral domain that generalises the notion of a Euclidean function on Euclidean domains. To wit, they proved that if an integral domain R has a Dedekind–Hasse norm, then R is a principal ideal domain.
