UFDs
- All principal ideal domains, hence all Euclidean domains, are UFDs
- If R is a UFD, then so is R[X], the ring of polynomials with coefficients in R. Unless R is a field, R[X] is not a principal ideal domain.
- In UFDs, every irreducible element is prime. (In any integral domain, every prime element is irreducible, but the converse does not always hold.
- Any two elements of a UFD have a greatest common divisor and a least common multiple. 
- many equivalent definitions
