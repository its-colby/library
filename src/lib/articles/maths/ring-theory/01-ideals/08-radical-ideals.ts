// semiprime ideal If xk is in A for some positive integer k and element x of R, then x is in A.

// If y is in R but not in A, all positive integer powers of y are not in A.

// In other words, an ideal is semiprime if it contains no nonzero nilpotent elements
// no repeated prime factors?
// Intersection of prime ideals is semiprime
// every prime ideal is semiprime but not vice versa

// radical of (6) = (2, 3)?

// having all radicals of an x
